# Determine if text is palindromic

## Description

This was an assignment during the first week of class at The Iron Yard Academy:
You have to write a program that, when run, asks the user to input some text. It can be a phrase, a sentence, or multiple sentences. After it is entered, your program will let the user know if it is a palindrome or not. Use "is a palindrome" and "is not a palindrome" in your output in order for the tests to pass.

### Deliverables

* A GitHub repo called palindrome containing at least:
  * This `README.md` file
  * a file called `palindrome.py`

### Requirements  

* Your program must pass the test script `test.sh`. To run this script, run `brew install roundup` first.
* Your program must output what it is doing at each step.
* Your program must use a recursive function.
